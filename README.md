# Designer Inc Recommender System

Designer Inc (designerinc.com) is an interior designer marketplace and services company. It is a trade-only sourcing and purchasing site listing hundreds of thousands of furniture and other interior design pieces. "Trade-only" refers to the special relationship between professional designers and manufacturers.

Designer Inc launched in mid 2017.

Currently designers can search the available 229k+ pieces using type, brand, dimensions, size, and color. They have 404k+ pieces in their database.

# Need

The manufacturers are typically small "Mom and Pop" operations making eclectic furniture which appeals to the professional interior designer. They do not update availability or discontinuation of any piece. This is discovered during a back-end pricing or final purchase order request. Before this site, Designers would discover this by working with sourcing experts or directly with the manufacturers themselves. This system is already a simplification for them.

When discovered as discontinued, a person from the Designer Inc team searches the available pieces for replacement recommendations.

First need: pieces are not defined by a style. If I can categorize pieces by style, then there can be a new element used for search and recommender criterion.

Styles can then be associated with nearest styles for an improvement in search and recommendations.

Secondary goal: To create a recommender system to identify X possible replacements for the Designer to select from or search.

If this is successful, then it's performance can be improved and used on the site.

Long term need: a better ordering of pieces on initial search. If the initial recommender can have quick enough performance, then Designers will get to their selections quicker.
