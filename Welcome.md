Welcome to DesignerInc

Hereâ€™s how DesignerInc can help you . . .
We make sourcing and purchasing easier by creating a single place to browse, get quotes and purchase from nearly 600 different trade-only manufacturers.  
As far as purchasing and how that works--Simply add items to your cart and we will do the work of calling/emailing to get a quote including shipping costs and lead times, and if you purchase, ordering and tracking your order for you.
We place our orders through the same showrooms and sales reps that you do, so no one loses out on their commissions.
As for pricing--Manufacturers view DesignerInc like a multi line showroom, and just like these showrooms, we do not charge the designers anything extra, but rather, the manufacturers give us a commission. 
And, as we grow, we'll be able to pass volume discounts on to you.
Please do not hesitate to reach out with additional questions or feedback. DesignerInc is new and evolving and we add improvements to the site every two weeks.  Your feedback helps us prioritize what we work on next and to mold this into what you want it to be. 
We're always here, and the chat function on the site reaches me personally as well as my team!
Thank you for being an important member of DesignerInc!
